= Random Problems

Only some random algorithmic problems that I eventually decided to put my
solutions to them here.

Below I will list the problems and in each folder there will be solutions
implemented in the programming language dedicated to that folder. And solution
files are named after the problem numbers.


1. There are `n` numbers between 1 and `n - 1` on the standard input. Read them and identify the duplicate.

2. Read a string from standard input and find the longest palindrome substring in it.

3. Do a bignum add and multiplication.

4. Read a `MxN` matrix of 0 and 1s. Then find how many islands of 1 are present in the matrix. (two 1s are in the same island if they are horizontally or vertically neighbors)
